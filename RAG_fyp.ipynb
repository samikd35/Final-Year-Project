introduction the ministry of education of ethiopia has announced the implementation of exit exam for all undergraduate program students public and private beginning with the 20232024 academic year in order to improve the quality of graduates produced by higher learning institutions the exit exam aimed at checking whether students have acquired the required knowledge skills and attitudes or not to implement this it requires determining competency areas for a specific program which is already completed based on the competency areas prepared it needs to plan the construction of tests planning of a test is a first and vital step in the construction of an achievement test an achievement test demands very systematic and careful planning as a fact that good planning is a symbol of success tests are the tools that provide scores that measure level of student learning and study program learning outcomes in order to achieve the valid and reliable measurement of student learning and program learning outcomes the development of valid and reliable test is the mandatory test should be able to measure student performance in all dimensions of knowledge skill and attitude the carefully planned test construction contributes to improve the overall quality of the test in terms of test content validity difficulty level discrimination power and test reliability test preparation is not an easy task it requires a careful planning and guideline to make the task simple test construction needs the preparation of test blue print test blueprint is defined as a complete plan that explains how to develop a test the term refers to a map or specification of assessment to ensure that all aspects of the curriculum and educational domains are covered by the assessment programs over a specified period of time it helps curriculum developerstest constructors to match various competencies with the course content and the appropriate modality of assessment generally test blueprint will help to ensure tests 1 appropriately assess the achievement of instructional objectives of the course 2 appropriately reflect key course goals objectives and the material learned or covered during the instruction period and 3 include the appropriate item formats along with the knowledge and skills being assessed 2 keeping this in mind the team has prepared this test blueprint document in order to help the test developers or content specialists in their process of valid and reliable test construction the major points considered in the process of preparing this test blue print guideline were the core competencies that have been already identified for the themes of courses the course contents course credit hours and the learning outcomes with their corresponding levels of achievement by learning domains in line with these the number of test items that should adequately assess the performance of students in all the content topics will be determined through discussion with the content specialists who construct the blueprint and test for their corresponding study program therefore the main purpose of this manual is to give direction on how to develop blueprint for content specialists so that they can develop a test blueprint for their respective program 2 objective of test blueprint test blueprint preparation is generally opted to assist the preparation of a test that is representative broadly sampled and consisting of complete knowledge domain expected of the ethiopian higher education students on completion of their study program the specific objectives of test blueprint are to facilitate the construction of a representative and balanced test items for the selected courses in accordance with the competencies identified guide test developers or writers to write or set appropriate test items 3 steps to develop test blueprint i listing the identified core competencies corresponding to the respective course ii listing the specific and minimum competencies to be assessed by the exam iii listing out the major learned course contents corresponding to these listed minimum competencies iv listing the specific measurable learning outcomes under these minimum competencies using action verbs note the number and the importance of these learning outcomes proportionally contribute to the total test items the weight of the categories of the list of learning outcomes under each competencies and contents should lead to the number of total test items to be constructed 3 v determination of the test format vi content weighting experts judge the weight to be given to the listed learning outcomes and their corresponding contents vii identifying the categories of learning domains to which each of these learning outcomes belongs using their action verbs viii construction of test blueprint table ix allocating the number of test items for each learning outcomes by their corresponding types and levels of learning domains x determination of the subtotal and total test items by their categories of learning domains and learning outcomes 4 issues to considered in test blueprint preparation i curriculum details ii course outlinesguidebook details lists of learning outcomes lecture notes textbooks and other curricular materials iii course contents pertinent to the respective learning outcomes iv time devoted to cover the content with in a course course credit hour v total test length ie total number of test items vi number of questions allocated to each content area using the proportion calculated vii weight for each item viii relevance of the content to students future career in addition to these following the template mentioned below will help to prepare the blueprint 5 required documents used for the test blueprint to prepare a test blueprint we used the following documents in our hand 1 identified core competencies and learning outcome of the program software engineering graduates are expected to demonstrate the following knowledge skill and attitudes i knowledge conduct investigation of complex problems using researchbased knowledge and research methods including design of experiments analysis and 4 interpretation of data and synthesis of information to provide valid conclusions adopt innovate select and apply appropriate state of the art software design and development tools methodologies resources and emerging

skillful and attitudinally matured graduates it contributes to prepare competent graduates as it can serve as a quality check for effectiveness it also helps in improving academic programs quality and effectiveness furthermore it can create the platform for cooperation among academic programs at different universities to work jointly to improve the programs quality in view of this this document is produced to assist the setting of the exit examinations for all programs which is being delivered by ministry of education to meet the graduation profile competency and learning outcome exit exam competency selection and identifying core course is done for 2016 ec graduating students as a result preparing test blueprint is necessary to prepare fairly distributed items based on the above
