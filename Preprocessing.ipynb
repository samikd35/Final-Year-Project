the total built environment from the macrolevel of town planning urban design and landscape to the microlevel of furniture and product design architecture equally importantly also refers to the product of such a design the practice of architecture is the act of planning and architectural designing structural conceptualization specifying supervising and giving general administration and responsible direction to the erection enlargement or alterations of buildings and built environments as a corollary to the first purpose mentioned architectural education should also aspire to improve the quality of architectural output in general and architectural practice in particular in addition to educating wellequipped graduates this can be done by research ie constantly expanding architectural knowledge by setting good examples by publishing and by fostering contacts with practices architectural design in engineering structures or any part thereof the scientific aesthetic and orderly coordination of all the processes which enter into the production of a complete building or structure performed through the medium of unbiased preliminary studies of plans consultations specifications conferences evaluations investigations contract documents and oral advice and directions architecture is one of the key professions involved in shaping the built environment and urban

business skills a civil engineer is someone who practices all or part of this art civil engineers are primarily responsible for the planning design and construction of infrastructure which includes major buildings bridges dams pipelines sewage and water treatment plants and various transportation systems and facilities in order to provide workable durable and affordable solutions to societys infrastructure needs civil engineers must develop an understanding of the physical laws that govern the actions of nature and their environmental forces and the behavior of natural and manmade materials it is not surprising therefore that basic research on mechanics of solids and fluids was initially conducted by civil engineers working on solutions to practical problems the importance of a sound knowledge based on these subjects is likely to increase in the future as civil engineers are called upon to build in more hostile and delicate environments to handle new materials and to preserve natural resources with thorough knowledge of both the principles of construction and the possible environmental consequences of a structure the civil engineers expertise is one that is essential to our present civilization and one that will become ever more valuable in the future 65 aastu student handbook 20232024 319 program educational objectives in ethiopia civil engineers are leaders in the conceptualization design construction and maintenance of the infrastructures on which the society depends civil engineers build and maintain bridges highways railways tunnels airports dams water treatment and distribution systems and large buildings along with many other structures civil engineers work on environmental projects such as ecological restoration waste containment and soil remediation sites or design of a safe and efficient transportation system as society evolves the solutions to civil engineering problems are no longer exclusively technical issues instead they require consideration of demographic trends human aspirations laws of supply and demand and in general social economic and political factors the civil engineers of the future will have to develop a better appreciation and understanding of these subjects to assume their rightful place in society 3110 program outcomes pos the practice of civil engineering includes the provision of professional
